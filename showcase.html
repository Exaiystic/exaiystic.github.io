								<h2>Procedurally Generated Dungeon Crawler Prototype</h2>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/gameplay/dungeoncrawlergameplay1.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									For my <b>Individual Games Technology Project</b> - also known as my <b>Final Year Project</b>, I decided to study into the 
									concept of procedurally generated game levels. I thought the best way to explore this topic would be to make a 2d dungeon-crawler
									game, where every dungeon is procedurally generated before playing, and is then regenerated upon game replay.
								</p>
								<p>
									After some research, I decided that I would generate my levels using a method of generation known as <b>The Random Walk</b>.
									The random walk consisted of an entity choosing a cardinal direction at random, taking one step in that direction, and then picking 
									a new direction, repeating this process for however long specified. This would result in a single path. To generate a room-like 
									shape with this method, I can repeat the process using the same start point.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/gameplay/generation1.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This gives us a single room, but for a dungeon layout we need a few rooms connected by corridors. Fortunately, we can use the random walk 
									generation to also give us our corridors - instead of picking a new direction after every step, what if we picked one direction and 
									moved x amount of steps in that one direction? The result would then be a straight path, but what if at the end of that path we had a 
									50% chance to either generate a room, or generate another corridor? That way we would have both rooms and corridors. This is known as 
									corridor-first generation, as - in a sense - we are generating corridors before rooms.
								</p>

									Here are both of the implementations within Unity:

									And here are some examples of full dungeon layouts when generated:
