								<h2>Procedurally Generated Dungeon Crawler Prototype</h2>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/gameplay/dungeoncrawlergameplay1.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									For my <b>Individual Games Technology Project</b> - also known as my <b>Final Year Project</b>, I decided to study into the
									concept of procedurally generated game levels. I thought the best way to explore this topic would be to make a 2d dungeon-crawler
									game, where every dungeon is procedurally generated before playing, and is then regenerated upon game replay.
								</p>
								<p>
									After some research, I decided that I would generate my levels using a method of generation known as <b>The Random Walk</b>.
									The random walk consisted of an entity choosing a cardinal direction at random, taking one step in that direction, and then picking
									a new direction, repeating this process for however long specified. This would result in a single path. To generate a room-like
									shape with this method, I can repeat the process using the same start point.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/gameplay/generation1.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									This gives us a single room, but for a dungeon layout we need a few rooms connected by corridors. Fortunately, we can use the random walk
									generation to also give us our corridors - instead of picking a new direction after every step, what if we picked one direction and
									moved x amount of steps in that one direction? The result would then be a straight path, but what if at the end of that path we had a
									50% chance to either generate a room, or generate another corridor? That way we would have both rooms and corridors. This is known as
									corridor-first generation, as - in a sense - we are generating corridors before rooms.
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/gameplay/generation2.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Here are both of the implementations within Unity:

								<p>
									And here are some examples of full dungeon layouts when generated:

								<h2>Pizza Time</h2>

								<p>
									During my Junior Collaborative project, I worked as a Junior Technician alongside one Senior Technician on Pizza Time - a game where the
									player plays as a flying pizza and has to collect as many pizza toppings before time runs out. Some features that I worked on include:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>The vehicle pathing system</p></li>
									<li><p>The turrets and homing birds</p></li>
									<li><p>The spin-dash mechanic</p></li>
									<li><p>The pizza sauce-fire mechanic</p></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Pizza Time can be downloaded and played from itch.io:</p>

								<h2>The Little Sapling</h2>
								<p>
									The Little Sapling is the game I designed with a team Juniors and Seniors for my Senior Collaborative Project. This time, I was the Senior technician
									on the group, working with one junior technician. I was in charge of developing features as well as managing and overseeing what the other
									technician was doing via Jira.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Little Sapling is a 3d puzzle platformer about a little sapling character who has to make it to the end of the level by solving puzzles using a
									hose attached to his back that he can spray various liquids out of.
								</p>
								<p>
									A proof-of-concept video of the game after a week in development:
								</p>
								<video width="1280" height="720" src="videos/saplingvid.mp4"></video>
								<p>
									A demonstration of the player using the water hose to hit a target that opens a door
								</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/gameplay/sapling1.gif" /></span>
								<p>
									The game featured crates that could be opened by spraying an acidic liquid onto the crates, revealing a bunch of gems that the player can then pick up.

								<h2>KEEP SHOOTING</h2>

								<p>
									KEEP SHOOTING is a game I made in the second year of my degree, for the Indie Game Development module. The module included documenting, creating
									and polishing a game from start to end completely independently (including visual assets). The game is a 2d platformer-shooter where the player
									has to fight their way to the end of a level. They play as a square, having to fight through armed shapes to reach the end.
								</p>
								<p>
									Developing this game allowed me to learn a lot about how a lot of different systems would be implemented - which would later be seen in future
									projects including my Final Year Project listed above. It also helped me to understand the pitfalls and issues of certain implementation techniques
									that I was able to reflect upon after the project had ended.
